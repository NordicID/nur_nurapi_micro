Notes
-------

Getting a uint16_t or uint32_t from byte buffer: if your MCU design allows unaligned memory accesses to 2-, 4- or 8-byte variables it is probably a good idea to handle the command parameters in packed structures ir order to make the code more readable.

As of writing this, the module FW does not yet support single tag fetching from the modules's buffer. Best workaround for this is likely to use low Q value (e.g. 2 or 3) and higher session value (2 or 3) to keep the amount of read data smaller and thus helping the MCU memory handling.

The NurApiConfig.h defines the inclusion, exclusion and implementation of certain functions e.g. "nurMemcpy" or "nurStrncpy".


What to implement:
-----------------

struct NUR_API_HANDLE transport functions:
TransportReadDataFunction
TransportReadDataFunction

See the API structure in the NurMicroApi.h: 'struct NUR_API_HANDLE'. The API structure contains the transport read and write functions.

See SerialTransport for win32 example.


NUR unsolicited notifications:
--------------------------------

struct NUR_API_HANDLE event handler function:
UnsolEventHandler

You can call NurApiWaitEvent() to wait for unsolicited notifications.
Event handler will be called when notification is received.

NOTE: It is recommended not to use streaming functions with micro api.
